# entra-ghub-automation
A serverless automation solution for synchronizing Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) groups with GitHub teams. When a user is added to a specific Entra group, they’re automatically assigned to the matching GitHub team—ensuring consistent access control, seamless onboarding, and enterprise-grade role-based security across both platforms.
